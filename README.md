Facial recognition using Local Directional Gradient Pattern.

The local directional gradient pattern is a 1D local micropattern computed by encoding the relationships between higher order derivatives of the reference pixel in four distinct directions. The descriptor identifies relationship between the high order derivatives of the referenced pixel in four different directions to compute the micropattern which corresponds to the local feature. The descriptor considerably reduces the length of the micropattern which consequently reduces the extraction time and matching time while maintaining the recognition rate.
